            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
            High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF, ISO/IEC 23008-12) specifies the storage of individual images,
            image sequences and their metadata into a container file conforming to the ISO Base Media File Format
            (ISO/IEC 14496-12). HEIF includes the storage specification of HEVC intra images and HEVC image
            sequences in which inter prediction is applied in a constrained manner. Use cases supported by HEIF
            include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Storage of still images as well as collection of images in a single container file,</li>
                    <li>Storage of burst photos,</li>
                    <li>Storage and efficient representation of video animations and cinemagraphs.</li>
                    <li>Support for simultaneous capture of video and still images, i.e. storing still images and timed image sequences into the same file.</li>
                    <li>Storage of images derived from other images of the file, either as derived images represented
                    by non-destructive image editing operations or as pre-computed derived images.</li>
                    <li>Storage of focal and exposure stacks into the same container file.</li>
                    <li>Support for storing other media, such as audio and timed text, into the same container file with
                    timed image sequences and synchronizing their playback.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As HEVC provides support for various chroma formats and sample fidelities up to lossless coding, the
                format can serve the whole spectrum of use cases from today's consumer devices storing images
                typically at 8 bits per sample to high-end professional devices with sample fidelity and dynamic range
                requirements going all the way up to 16 bits per sample.
            </p>

            <p>
                Computational photography forms a new category of use cases that can benefit from the HEIF file
                format. Now a set of related images can be stored in a single file with associated metadata indicating
                relationships between different pictures.
            </p>

            <p>
                HEIF specifies a structural format, from which codec-specific image formats can be derived. HEIF also
                includes the specification for encapsulating images and image sequences conforming to the High
                Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC, ISO/IEC 23008-2 | ITU-T Rec. H.265).
            </p>

            <p>
                In ISOBMFF, a continuous or timed media or metadata stream forms a track, whereas static media or
                metadata is stored as items. Consequently, HEIF has the following basic design:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1. Still images are stored as items. Typically image items are independently coded, and do not depend on
                        any other item in their decoding. If predictively coded image items with coding dependencies are present,
                        this is clearly signalled. Any number of image items can be included in the same file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. Image sequences are stored as tracks. An image sequence track can be indicated to be displayed
                        either as a timed sequence or in a non-timed manner, such as a gallery of images. An image
                        sequence track may be used instead of image items when there is coding dependency between
                        images.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                A file may contain both image items and image sequence tracks along with other media. For example, it
                is possible to create a file, which includes image items or image sequence tracks conforming to HEIF, and
                audio and timed text tracks conforming to any derivative format of the ISOBMFF.

                <b><span class="heif-image-caption">Image I. ISOBMFF compliant file high level structure with meta box and items</span></b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Files conforming to ISOBMFF consist of a sequence of data structures called boxes, each containing a
                four-character code (4CC) indicating the type of the box, the size of the box in terms of bytes, and the
                payload of the box. Boxes may be nested, i.e. a box may contain other boxes. ISOBMFF and HEIF specify
                constraints on the allowed box order and hierarchy.
            </p>

            <h3>HEIF Related Brands and MIME Types</h3>

            <p>
                Files conforming to HEIF start with a FileTypeBox as defined in the ISOBMFF standard, which contains a
                list of brands the file complies with. As the FileTypeBox is located at the start of the file, it provides
                easily accessible indications of the file contents to media players. Each brand is identified by its unique
                four-character code. The specification of a brand can include requirements and constraints for files of
                the brand and for file players supporting the brand. A brand included in the FileTypeBox permits a player
                that supports the requirements of the brand to play the file.
            </p>

            <p>
                The brands specified in the HEIF standard are presented in Table I. The HEIF standard specifies the 'mif1'
                and 'msf1' structural brands. Additionally, HEVC-specific brands are specified as listed in Table I. The
                dedicated brand names, 'heic' and 'hevc' indicates that HEVC Main Profile is utilized.

            <p>
                Internet media types, also known as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types, are used by
                various applications to identify the type of a resource or a file. MIME types consist of a media type
                ('image' in the case of HEIF files), a subtype, and zero or more optional parameters. For multi-purpose
                files, the selection of the subtype can be made on the basis of the primary use of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                An optional codecs MIME parameter can be present to indicate the used coding formats of the tracks
                and items present in the file. The codecs MIME parameter also includes the profile-tier-level value to
                which an HEVC-coded image item or an image sequence track conforms. More information about the
                MIME type registration and optional parameter can be found in Annex D and Annex E of the HEIF
                standard.
            </p>

            <h3>Comparison to other Image Formats</h3>
            <p>
                Table IX provides a comparison of the features of HEIF to other
                selected image formats. It can be observed that HEIF is more extensible and comprehensive than the
                other compared file formats. Particularly the possibility to include other media types, the advanced
                multi-picture features, and the support for non-destructive editing make HEIF more advanced than the
                other formats. The rich set of features make HEIF suitable for a broad range of devices and applications,
                including for example burst photography.

                The results indicate that JPEG would require on average 139 % higher bitrate than HEVC
                (i.e. 2.39 times the file size) in order to achieve the same objective picture quality. For JPEG-XR and
                JPEG-2000 the average increase in bitrates are 66 % and 44 %, respectively.

            <p>
                Multiple images can be stored in a HEIF file. It can be useful to differentiate between them by
                assigning them certain roles. The roles specified in HEIF are listed and described in <a href="#table-6">Table VI</a>.
                Note that a single image can be associated with more than one role.

            <h3>Properties of Images</h3>
            <p>HEIF allows the storage of image properties which are shared among different image items in a compact
               way. These properties are stored in ItemPropertyContainerBox. There are mainly two types of properties:
               descriptive and transformative. Descriptive properties provide information about the image item without
               applying modifications on the image itself. Transformative properties provide information about the
               transformative modification that needs to be done on the image item. The order of application of these
               properties to the image items are defined in the standard. <a href="#table-7">Table VII</a> lists currently
               defined properties. In addition to descriptive image properties, image items can optionally be
               characterized with metadata items, the format of which follows Exif, XMP, or MPEG-7 metadata.

            <h3>Derived Images</h3>
            <p>
                Derived images enable non-destructive image editing, where the original coded images are kept in the
                file, while new images, called derived images, can be introduced by specifying a transformation operation
                that is applied to one or more input images. HEIF specifies the generic structures used for storing
                derived images as items as well as a few specific types of derived images. Derived images can also have
                descriptive or transformative image properties.  Item references of type 'dimg' specify the input image(s)
                of the derived image. The input images can be coded images or derived images. The derived image types
                specified in the HEIF standard are listed in <a href="#table-8">Table VIII</a>. Other types may be specified
                in other documents or later versions of the HEIF standard.

                <a href="examples.html">Here are some examples of Derived Images</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Predictively Coded Images</h3>
            <p>
                Predictively coded image items have several benefits, such as selecting
                any image from an image sequence as the cover image, higher compression efficiency, and avoiding re-encoding when converting an image sequence to image items.
                Presence of predictively coded image items, which have one or more other coded image items as decoding dependencies,
                is signalled with 'pred' brand. Decoding dependencies and order for predictively coded image items are specified
                by item references of type 'pred'.
            </p>

            <h3>Image Metadata</h3>
            <p>
                HEIF files allow the storage of the metadata which can be related to images and image sequences.
                Such metadata can be information related to integrity checks, EXIF or XMP data or MPEG-7 related
                metadata. For image items, such metadata can be stored as a metadata item and reference the related
                image items with a ‘cdsc’ item reference. For image sequences, timed metadata tracks can refer to an
                image sequence track with a ‘cdsc’ track reference.
            </p>

            <h3>Indicating Alternative Representations</h3>

            <p>
                HEIF files can contain several image items representing the same image content
                (i.e. alternative representations). A media player may select one of the alternative representations
                of the same image content for displaying. A mechanism, known as entity grouping (defined in the
                GroupsListBox), is used for indicating alternate groups, which can contain both image items and media
                tracks (image sequences). The capability to define alternate groups between tracks and image items
                provides a unique mechanism for display initialization based on preferences of the media player and the
                content creator. Examples where alternate groups can be useful are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The same original image is coded into two or more image items with different properties, such as spatial resolution, bit-depth, or color gamut.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The same original image is coded into two or more image items with a different coding format or profile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A timed image sequence, such as a cinemagraph, is an alternative to an image item.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Image sequences</h3>

            <p>
                Images that have a particular correlation (e.g. image bursts or animations like cinemagraphs) can be
                efficiently stored in HEIF files, thanks to the inherited media track features of ISOBMFF. Such images
                are called image sequences and they can reside in the same file with image items.
                <a href="#table-9">Table IX</a> lists the roles of the image sequence tracks which are currently defined.

                            An image sequence that complements a master image sequence. For example, a sequence of
                            alpha plane or depth map images. Can assist in displaying the master image sequence but is not typically displayed as such.

                    <tr>

                            An image sequence that is not a thumbnail image sequence or an auxiliary image sequence.
                            Typically contains full-resolution displayable images.

            <p>
                HEIF enables the usage of Inter-picture prediction for compact storage of image sequences. Moreover,
                image sequence use cases may require faster access to individual images and the ability to edit
                individual images without affecting any other images. HEIF therefore includes the following two features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CodingConstraintsBox to indicate prediction constraints which applies to all the linked samples.
                    For example, it can be indicated that all reference images used for inter-picture prediction are
                    intra-coded images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    DirectReferenceSamplesList to have sample-wise listing of referenced samples using the sample
                    grouping mechanism of ISOBMFF. This feature enables decoding of only those samples that are needed
                    for accessing a particular sample (e.g. random access) and avoids the need of sequential decoding
                    of each sample starting from the previous intra-coded image.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Processing of image items by file players</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> illustrates how a file player processes the coded images and the derived images included in a
                file. The file player decodes a coded image into a reconstructed image. Similarly, the file player
                applies the operation of the derived image to the indicated one or more input images to obtain the
                respective reconstructed image. The descriptive image properties generally describe the reconstructed
                image, with the exception of the decoder configuration and initialization information, which is
                associated with the coded image. The transformative image properties, if any, are applied to the
                reconstructed image to obtain an output image. The output image can be displayed, when the coded
                image or the derived image is not a hidden image. The output image can also act as an input image to
                derived images.

            <h3>Storing HEVC Encoded Pictures in HEIF: HEVC Image Files</h3>
            <p>
                The HEIF standard includes the specification for encapsulating HEVC-coded images and image sequences into HEIF-compliant files. The specification includes the following aspects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The sample entry format and the sample format of HEVC image sequence tracks are identical to those of the HEVC video tracks specified in ISO/IEC 14496-15. For compatibility with HEVC-capable video players, it is therefore advisable to create both an HEVC image sequence track and an HEVC video track that refer to the same coded images. This is called a Dual-Branded File and has an insignificant impact on the file size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The format of the decoder configuration information in the HEVC configuration item property is identical to that in the sample entry format. Likewise, the item format is identical to the sample format of HEVC video and image sequence tracks. This enables having the same intra-coded image as an image item and as a sample in an HEVC image sequence or video track.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The configuration information of alpha planes and depth maps follows the respective supplemental enhancement information of HEVC.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Multi-Image Application Format (MIAF)</h3>
            <p>
                The Multi-Image Application Format (MIAF) specification defines additional constraints and interoperability points to ensure higher interoperability, while fully conforming to the HEIF format.
                This is done by defining specific constraints, limiting the supported encoding types to a set of specific profiles and levels (see <a href="#table-11">Table XI</a>), requiring specific metadata formats, and defining a set of brands for signalling such constraints (see <a href="#table-12">Table XII</a>). This enables the industry to deploy particular uses of the HEIF specification.
